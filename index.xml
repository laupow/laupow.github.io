      <description>A small frustrationÂ with Ansible is the initial setup to procure ssh access to the remote hosts. Ansible is a great tool to automate all the things. However, it assumes you already have ssh access to the remote hosts. Say your operations team member writes an Ansible deploy playbook to share with the team. It works for the operations team member locally, but other users won&amp;rsquo;t be able to run the playbook until they also have ssh access to the remote hosts.</description>

      <description>Below I&amp;rsquo;ve outline four useful but less common Ansible strategies. My primary use cases for Ansible are application configuration, application deployment, and local development environments. The patterns aren&amp;rsquo;t overly technical, nor do they rely on hacks. But they do represent a few unusual problems Ansible can help solve.
Skip Module Parameters With Omit Filter Say you have a playbook task that needs to accept multiple module parameters which are themselves incompatible.</description>
